The dataset contains 4,213 entries and 21 columns, all of which have complete data (no missing values). The columns provide information about weather conditions and solar power generation, including:

Temperature, humidity, pressure, precipitation, and cloud cover at different levels.
Wind speed and direction at 10m, 80m, and 900mb above ground level.
Solar parameters like shortwave radiation, angle of incidence, zenith, and azimuth.
The main output column, generated_power_kw, represents the generated solar power in kilowatts.
